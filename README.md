I am a Java/Backend developer looking forward to master Android mobile skills and create great Android apps and hopefully get a new job :).
I have no experience or knowledge in Kotlin.
I really like playing soccer, learning new things (at the moment I'm still learning English) and attending to workshops or software conferences.
